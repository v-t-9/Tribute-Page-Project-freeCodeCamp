                        Dr. René Favaloro was born in 1923 in La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina. He inherited his love for knowledge and nature from his grandmother to whom he dedicated his Phd. Thesis.

                        When graduated from La Plata University in 1949,  he received a letter from an uncle who lived in Jacinto Aráuz a rural town of 3500 inhabitants. In the letter, his uncle was asking him to come to work in the town because its doctor was sick and needed to go to Buenos Aires for treatment. The town doctor died and, René and his brother, who was also a doctor, stayed in the town for 12 years.
                        During those years, they founded a care center and, a blood bank. In addition,  helped to reduce malnutrition, infant mortality, and the number of infections during birth, which were the town´s main health problems.

                        Favaloro was amazed by the first cardiovascular interventions and wanted to specialize in that branch of medicine.  When he asked about it, he was recommended to travel to the Cleveland Clinic. He had doubts about leaving his job as a rural doctor. But he thought that he would be able to help the community more when he returned to Argentina.

                        In 1967 he began to think about the possibility of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery. This technique, called bypass or myocardial revascularization surgery, was the main work of his career, which gave him international prestige, since the procedure radically changed the history of coronary heart disease.

                        Dr. Favaloro traveled back to Argentina in 1971 with the idea to start a center similar to the Cleveland Clinic in his country. In 1975, la “Fundación Favaloro” was created. It purpose was to not only be a medical center but also, a learning center.
